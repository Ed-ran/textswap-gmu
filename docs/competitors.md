# Competitors & Differentiation

**Bookstore buyback:** Safe but low payouts → TextSwap keeps safety via escrow + market pricing
**FB/GroupMe swaps:** Higher potential payout, but risky & unenforced → TextSwap adds escrow, .edu verification, campus density
**Amazon/Chegg buy/sell:** Convenient but slower & fee-heavy → TextSwap leverages local pickup speed and lower friction
